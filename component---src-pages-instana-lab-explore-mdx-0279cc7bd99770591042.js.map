Feel free to navigate through all the different details views for Namespaces, Deployments, Services etc. Some words of notice here. Observability is useless without context. Therefore Instana is setting all the collected data into context, we will explore that in the further modules of this lab, but you can see the context that Instana is adding when you look at the title section of this Details page. From this page you can navigate `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Upstream/Downstream`}</strong>{` through the Stack, because that is the context that Instana adds to the collected data. Further Details will be provided in the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Context Guide`}</strong>{` section of this lab.`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <p>{`Let’s explore how Instana can present cluster details differently.

This is the Overview page of all platform and infrastructure resources. In huge enivronments, the view can look crowded.\nIn a later section we will cover how to filter the view and navigate through the so called `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`dynamic graph`}</strong>{` that Instana builds up for you.\nSome basic navigation hints on the infrastructure map:\nYou are able in and out in the map with the mouse wheel.\nLeft Click in the map, holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse lets you move the map around.\nThe further you zoom into the map, the more details you see. In the following image you see a how we can zoom and focus on a specific cluster in this map, in this example in a zone called IBM Cloud.\n`}<img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"/images/instana-explore-infra-zoom-a.png\",\n        \"alt\": \"Instana Explore Infrastructure Zoom In\"\n      }}></img>{`\nIn this zoom detail you already see that on this Linux based k8s host, different containers have been observed (marked with the red arrow) and on the side of the containers we can already see which technology Instana has discovered.\nThe display options for the map can be changed with the options on the lower right corner (marked with the red rectangle).\nInstead of arranging the zones by names you can change that to a more compact view for huge environments. You can rearrange based on different metrics etc.\nFor the purpose of this lab it is sufficient to stay with the defaults.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When you click on a displayed resource on the map, like in the following image a java process (marked with the red arrow), a mini dashboard is displayed with the data, Instana has discovered.\n`}<img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"/images/instana-explore-infra-zoom-b.png\",\n        \"alt\": \"Instana Explore Infrastructure Zoom In\"\n      }}></img>{`\nFrom there you see the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Open Dashboard`}</strong>{` button which will lead you directly to the Application details. But you see also that it is possible to navigate within this map through the complete stack, upstream or downstream.\nIn the red box in the image above you see that you are able to navigate from the java process upstream through the container, the node, the kubernetes platform up to the host where the process is running.\nFeel free to explore these navigation capabilities and how you are from here redirected to the corresponding details page.`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <p>{`Looking further down the Navigation Bar, there is the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Analytics`}</strong>{` section.\n`}<img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"/images/instana-explore-analytics.png\",\n        \"alt\": \"Instana Explore Analytics\"\n      }}></img>{`\nThis view is intended to give you a detailed look on traces and page loads for Websites, Mobile Apps and Applications.
