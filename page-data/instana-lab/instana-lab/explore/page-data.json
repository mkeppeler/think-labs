Use the user and password combination that you have created when setting up your environment.\nIn case you have not created your Instana account in the lab environment, got to the Setup Environment section, open the Invitation email from Instana and follow the steps to create your account.\n\nWhen logging in to Instana you are presented with the Default Dashboard, showing you the overview and current status of the observed Websites, Mobile Apps, Applications, Platforms and Infrastructure.\nThere is a default dashboard built in, but you are able to define your own dashboard for the resources that you are interested in. For this session the built in custom dashboard is sufficient.\n![Instana Home](/images/instana-explore-home.png)\nThe dashboard gives you at a glance a view to the actual status and informs you about important performance indicators, like the number of Calls, the latency or the erroneous call rate for applications as an example.\nFrom this summary dashboard you are able to open the detailed dashboards directly for specific applications, platforms or infrastructures. If you like, take your time to explore the default dashboard and scroll down through the various sections.\n\nYou can change the observation scope for the dashboard, when clicking on the time indicator in the upper right corner.\n![Instana Scope Change](/images/instana-explore-scopechange.png)\nSelect the appropiate time window you want to observe, or choose a tag for a specific Release.\n\nFor a deeper look, use the left side navigation bar of Instana. When you move your mouse cursor to the left side of the screen, the navigation bar will expand.\nBefore digging into the specific section one word of notice: In this lab we will focus on cloud-native applications based on kubernetes deployments.\nTherefore in the platform navigation item you see only Kubernetes mentioned, like in the in the screen shot underneath.\n![Instana Nav Bar](/images/instana-explore-navigation.png)\nIf you have configured also Cloud Foundry or VMWare VSphere as an observed platform, you will see these also in the platform section like this:\n![Instana Nav Bar Alternative](/images/instana-explore-navigation-b.png)\n\nAt any time you are able to return to the default dashboard by clicking on the Stan, Instana's logo, at the top of the Navigation bar.\nNext under the Stan logo is the **Websites & Mobile Apps** menu item.\n![Instana Explore Websites](/images/instana-explore-eum.png)\nInstana is able to do End user monitoring for Websites and Mobile Apps. This is done by adding so called **beacons** to your end user interfaces, which reports data like browser information, location and other telemetry data from the client side to the backend.\nAn example of a Website that is configured for End user monitoring is shown in the following example:\n![Instana Explore Websites Detail](/images/instana-explore-eum-detail.png)\nYou will see the page views for the configured site, any JS Errors, performance data and also information like from where the site has been called. At the top you see that you can filter on Browser, operating system, country, etc. to narrow down a potential problem.\n\nThe next section of the navigation bar is the **Applications** section. Instana agents automatically discover, e.g. the resources on observerd Kubernetes cluster. The automatically discovered resources will, by default, displayed as **All Services** in the Applications list.\n![Instana Explore Applications](/images/instana-explore-apps.png)\nTo make it easier for you to find the data you are interested in, you are able to add a custom **Application Perspective**, that covers e.g. resources from a specific namespace or that is marked with a specific flag. You can add a custom Application perspective by clicking on the +Add link at the lower right corner of the Applications Dashboard.\n![Instana Explore Applications Perspective Add](/images/instana-explore-apps-perspective-add.png)\nYou do not have to do this at this point in time as we are describing and using that in detail in the **Observe Your Environment** section.\n\nThe platform section in the navigation bar is, as already mentioned, for the purpose of this lab configured to show only Kubernetes as platform, but can be used also for Cloud Foundry or VMWare Vsphere resources.\nWhen you click on the **Kubernetes Platform** Menu item you are presented with the overview Dashboard of all the clusters that have been supplied with an instana agent installation. The information that you see in this section is automatically discovered by the instana agents, that run as daemon sets on the clusters. In this view you see a summary of the kubernetes specific resoures like namespaces, services, pods etc.\n![Instana Explore Platforms](/images/instana-explore-k8s.png)\nWhen you select one of the clusters you are forewarded to a more detailed view of the cluster.\n![Instana Explore K8s detail](/images/instana-explore-k8s-detail.png)\nAs you can see, Instana agents discover a lot of data automatically and provides you with a structured view to them. Feel free to navigate through all the different details views for Namespaces, Deployments, Services etc. Some words of notice here. Observability is useless without context. Therefore Instana is setting all the collected data into context, we will explore that in the further modules of this lab, but you can see the context that Instana is adding when you look at the title section of this Details page. From this page you can navigate **Upstream/Downstream** through the Stack, because that is the context that Instana adds to the collected data. Further Details will be provided in the **Context Guide** section of this lab.\n\n---\n\nLet's explore how Instana can present cluster details differently. When you click on the Pods tab of the Cluster Details (marked with the red arrow in the image above), you are directed to a table view of all the pods running on your cluster.\n![Instana Explore K8s Pods detail](/images/instana-explore-k8s-detail-b.png)\nYou can toggle between the table view and a map view (marked by the red rectangle), so that the running pods can be displayed and grouped on different data like CPU Limits or Requests, or Memory Limits or Requests.\n![Instana Explore K8s Pods map ](/images/instana-explore-k8s-detail-c.png)\nFeel free to experiment with the different configuration options on configuring the Map of your running pods.\n\n---\n\nnext to the Platforms Navigation Item, there is the **Infrastructure** section in the Navigation bar.\n![Instana Explore Infrastructure](/images/instana-explore-infra.png)\nWhen you select this one, you are redirected to the overall infrastructure map of all the different resources that Instana agents have discovered. This is the Overview page of all platform and infrastructure resources. In huge enivronments, the view can look crowded.\nIn a later section we will cover how to filter the view and navigate through the so called **dynamic graph** that Instana builds up for you.\nSome basic navigation hints on the infrastructure map:\nYou are able in and out in the map with the mouse wheel.\nLeft Click in the map, holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse lets you move the map around.\nThe further you zoom into the map, the more details you see. In the following image you see a how we can zoom and focus on a specific cluster in this map, in this example in a zone called IBM Cloud.\n![Instana Explore Infrastructure Zoom In](/images/instana-explore-infra-zoom-a.png)\nIn this zoom detail you already see that on this Linux based k8s host, different containers have been observed (marked with the red arrow) and on the side of the containers we can already see which technology Instana has discovered.\nThe display options for the map can be changed with the options on the lower right corner (marked with the red rectangle).\nInstead of arranging the zones by names you can change that to a more compact view for huge environments. You can rearrange based on different metrics etc.\nFor the purpose of this lab it is sufficient to stay with the defaults.\n\nWhen you click on a displayed resource on the map, like in the following image a java process (marked with the red arrow), a mini dashboard is displayed with the data, Instana has discovered.\n![Instana Explore Infrastructure Zoom In](/images/instana-explore-infra-zoom-b.png)\nFrom there you see the **Open Dashboard** button which will lead you directly to the Application details. But you see also that it is possible to navigate within this map through the complete stack, upstream or downstream.\nIn the red box in the image above you see that you are able to navigate from the java process upstream through the container, the node, the kubernetes platform up to the host where the process is running.\nFeel free to explore these navigation capabilities and how you are from here redirected to the corresponding details page.\n\n---\n\nLooking further down the Navigation Bar, there is the **Analytics** section.\n![Instana Explore Analytics](/images/instana-explore-analytics.png)\nThis view is intended to give you a detailed look on traces and page loads for Websites, Mobile Apps and Applications. Therefore this section is accessible from those dashboards. Every time you see a button with the notion of **Analysze** in it, e.g. **Analyze Calls** from any Application perspective, you will be redirected to this analytics page.\nThis lab has a complete section only covering this. Refer to section **Analyse a problem** for the details on how to take intelligent actions on the observed metrics.\n\n---\n\nFinally, apart from the administrative sections of Instana, that we do not cover in this lab, there is the **Events** Menu item from the Navigation Bar.\n![Instana Explore Events ](/images/instana-explore-events.png)\nEvents can be changes, like state changes of pods in Kubernetes clusters, it can be warnings, incidents or issues that needs your attention and immediate action. Instana comes with a rich set of preconfigured Event rules and you are able to add more, custom rules based on your own settings.\nGiven that Instana is able to detect the events on the basis of the collected data, it is possible to forward this through alert channels in Instana to other tools for error remediation, e.g. to IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.\n\nNow that you are familiar with the basic UI capabilities, please proceed to the next module for this lab.\n\n\n\n<AnchorLink>Exploring the UI</AnchorLink>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"621c5fb85134adbed0a9469a40e9c869","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":371},"frontmatter":{"title":"Exploring the UI","description":"Exploring the Instana user interface and get familar"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Exploring the UI\ndescription: Exploring the Instana user interface and get familar\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis section is intended to make you familiar with the capabilities of the Instana User interface.\nThrougout this lab you will get a deeper understanding of specific themes, so that we show in this section the basic navigation and the \"What to find where?\"\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## Exploring the UI\n\nIf not already done, login to the [Instana user interface](https://lab1-instanathink21.instana.io).
