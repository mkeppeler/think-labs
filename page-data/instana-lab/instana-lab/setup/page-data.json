If you have already one, you may use that one. If you do not have an IBM Cloud account, create a free tier account. No credit card information is required.\nFollow these steps to create your IBM Cloud account.\n\n1. Open the [IBM Cloud portal](https://cloud.ibm.com/)\n\n   ![IBM Cloud login](./images/login-ibmcloud.png)\n\n2. Choose \"Create an account\"\n3. On the account creation page you have to provide only your Mail address, a secure password and your full name and region where you are from. No further information is required.\n   ï¿¼\n   ![Create Cloud account](./images/ibmcloud-createaccount-start.png)\n\n4. Within 30 minutes after providing your mail address, enter the verification code and add your Full name and region and click on \"Create\"\n\n   ![Finish Cloud account](./images/ibmcloud-verify.png)\n\n5. After confirming the GDPR related information (What data IBM uses and what are your rights!), you are already logged in to your free tier IBM Cloud account.\n\n   ![Cloud account start page](./images/ibmcloud-welcome.png)\n\nFeel free to explore your free IBM Cloud Account and what capabilities you have with that. For working on your lab you have nothing more to do at this moment. You will be invited for working with the lab environment to a special cloud account where you will get your own reserved cluster.\n\n\n## Connecting to the Instana Backend\n\nThrougout the lab all participants will use a central Instana backend installation. In preparation for this session you should have received an invitation to an Instana backend and should have accepted the invitation and created your account.\nIf not already done, please open the email that you got and that should look similar to this one:\n![Instana Invite email](./images/instana_invite.png)\n\nWhen you click on the  **Join Instana** button, you are directed to a sequence of steps to create your account.\nIn the first step provide your full name and create your unique password.\n![Instana create account](./images/instana_account_create.png)\n\nClicking on **Sign up** gives the following sequence of steps: \nReading and accepting the terms of use.\n![Instana account terms 1](./images/instana_account_create_terms_a.png)\n\nSet your preferece for receiving information from Instana to your given email.\n![Instana account terms 2](./images/instana_account_create_terms_b.png)\n\nSet your Cookie preferences.\n![Instana account terms 3](./images/instana_account_create_terms_c.png)\n\nComplete your profile, i.e. provide data for your role. (Select one from the list.)\n![Instana account terms 4](./images/instana_account_create_terms_d.png)\n\nWith the confirmation to save all the data that you have provided for the account setup you are than redirected to the First time user welcome page of Instana.\n![Instana welcome](./images/instana_first_time_welcome.png)\n\nFor now you are all set. The next steps, after hitting the **Go to Instana** link will be explained in the further sessions.\n\n\n## Connecting to your Cluster within IBM Cloud\nAs a preparation of this lab, we have sent you an email with instructions on how to create your IBM Cloud account.\nFor the next step it is essential that you have set up your own free tier IBM Cloud account, as we need to invite you to that account that is used in the lab.\nIf you do not have set up your cloud account please inform the instructor, so that they can assist you.\nProceed with the following steps only if you have successfully created your IBM Cloud account.\n\nReserve a Kubernetes cluster\n  - To save time, all clusters needed have been created already for you. Use the [Reservation App](https://instanahsttest.eu-de.mybluemix.net/) to open the Reservation tool.\n    ![Reserve cluster](./images/cluster-reserve-start2.png)\n  - Provide the lab-key that you have received from your instructors and the IBM ID that you have used to create your IBM Cloud Account. It is necessary that you check the Terms and Conditions for the use of the lab and Click on the \"Submit\" Button.\n    The application will look for an unassigned cluster for you, invite you to the lab Cloud account and gives you access rights ***only*** to your reserved cluster instance. A successfull reservation should result in the following message:\n    ![Reserve cluster success](./images/cluster-reserve-success.png)\n    To connect to your reserved cluster instance, click on \"Log in to the **IBM Cloud account**\"-Link, which will log you into the account for the workshop.\n    If everything is successfull, you should see a dashboard within the lab account and one single cluster that is reserved for you. (Similar to the following image)\n    ![Cluster reservation success](./images/cluster-access-labaccount.png)\n  - Open the details of your cluster environment, through clicking on the name of your cluster. On the details page of your cluster you find all information to connect to your cluster. You are able to connect to your cluster from your own machine and a terminal session or by using the IBM Cloud shell, where you do not have to install anything locally.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Cloud Shell\">\n\nOn the Overview page of your IKS Cluster click on the Terminal Shell Icon in the upper right corner.\n\n![Access Cloud shell](./images/cluster-use-cloud-shell-start.png)\n\nThe Cloud Shell terminal will open within a new browser tab as shown below.\n\n![Cloud shell terminal](./images/cluster-use-cloud-shell-1.png)\n\nThe Cloud Shell takes some time to start.\n\nYou are already logged in to the Cloud account, but the context for kubectl is not configured. In order to do that, you have to load the cluster configuration, by executing the following code in your Cloud shell:\n```\nibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster $(ibmcloud ks cluster ls | grep lab2220 | awk '{print $2}')\n```\n\nCheck you access to the cluster is working by executing\n\n```\nkubectl get nodes\n```\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"CLI\">\n\nFor the procedure to run the lab from your own, local terminal session, follow the steps on the **Access** page of your Cluster overview page.\nEspecially it is important to install at least ibmcloud, kubectl and helm 3 on your local environment, for a successfull completion of the lab.\n\n```\nibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r eu-de -g default --sso\nAPI endpoint: https://cloud.ibm.com\n\nGet a one-time code from https://identity-3.eu-central.iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/passcode to proceed.\nOpen the URL in the default browser?

For example, run 'kubectl get nodes'.\nIf you are accessing the cluster for the first time, 'kubectl' commands might fail for a few seconds while RBAC synchronizes.\n```\n\nCheck you access to the cluster is working by executing\n\n```\nkubectl get nodes\n```\n\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n\n\n\n  We want to use helm charts for deploying applications to the defined clusters. Helm is already available in the cloud shell. We need to use Helm version 3.\n  To use helm 3 in the commands, use the alias helm3 as in the following example:\n  ```\n  helm3 version\n  ```\n  This results in a view similar to this one. Which means you have now setup your cluster configuration and helm prepared to run the lab.\n  ![Cloud shell setup finish](./images/helm-version-test.png)\n\nCongratulations. You have successfully setup your environment with all the necessary tools to complete the lab.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ddf189d433d77417d8d6fa3a4290972a","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":309},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setup your Environment","description":"Environment onboarding"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Setup your Environment\ndescription: Environment onboarding\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThe Lab environment consists of a central Instana backend installation to which every participant will connect his/her individual cluster that is already prepared for you in the IBM Kubernetes Service within IBM Cloud.\nA browser to connect to the Instana backend and to IBM Cloud and your Kubernetes cluster is the only requirement for this lab.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## Create a free tier IBM Cloud Account\nFor the labs you need to have an IBM Cloud account.
