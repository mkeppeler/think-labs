A complete list of supported environments is available in the Instana Documentation.\n\nThere two type of agents avavailable, the dynamic or the static host agent. The static agent brings all the sensors to monitor the processes int he environment, whereas the dynamic agent connects to a sensor reposistory and downloads the needed sensors on demand. Also sensor updates are dynamic as new version are made availabe.\n\nIn this lab we will use the dynamic host agent.\n\nTo get to the installation options for K8s navigate in the menue on the left of the Instana UI to `More -> Agents` and click on **Installing Instana Agents**\n\n<Row>\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![instana-agent](./images/instana-agent.png)\n\n  </Column>\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![instana-agent-install](./images/instana-agent-install.png)\n\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n\n\nSelect Kubernetes as platform\n\nYou can explore the other platforms and their installation option if you like.\n\nFrom the **Technology** dropdown select **Operator** as installation option.
